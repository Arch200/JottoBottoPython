# JottoBottoPython

JottoBotto is a game I created heavily inspired by the game 'Jotto'. In Jotto there are two players: Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob both choose a word that has no repeating letters, "four" is allowed but "area" is not because it has 2 letter 'a's. Alice would try to guess Bob's word and Bob would respond with the number of letters Alice's guess had in common with the word Bob chose. So if Bob chose "four" and Alice guessed "five", Bob would respond "1" and then it would be Bob's turn to guess Alice's word. Whoever guessed the other's word first is the winner. 

In JottoBotto, the computer chooses a word at random and the player has to guess the word. The computer is not able to guess words back so this is a single player version.
